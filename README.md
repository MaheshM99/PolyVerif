# PolyVerif
PolyVerif AV Validation Suite

Background & Overview 
The project addresses the problem of Autonomous Vehicle Validation for a particular route/road network.  The baseline situation considered is a city or town that has to put in an autonomous vehicle capability (typically in a geofenced area).  Given a topology (location, road network) the system should automatically build edge condition cases which can serve as a basis for a safety report.
 
The problem statement is:
Various cities, towns, and campuses are exploring the use of autonomous vehicle shuttles. The technical specifications for such a vehicle are low speed, public transport, and fixed route, operated by the city.
 The project requirement is to verify safety of these Autonomous Vehicles in the context of:
    1. Dynamic: cars, pedestrians, and various models
    2. Weather: various stress points on the sensor network
    3. RF: various stress points on the communications network
