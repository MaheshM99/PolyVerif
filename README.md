# PolyVerif
PolyVerif AV Validation Suite

PolyVerif is an open-source autonomy validation research framework whose objectives are to accelerate the state-of-art for autonomy design and validation. 

The focus of the framework is:
To enable a coherent and integrated Design of Experiment (DoE) capability.
Use open-source ecosystems such as Autoware, Unity (not open-source but easily available), LGSVL, and SCENIC. 
   1. Captures a physical AV environment
   2. Performs extensive VV&C in a virtual environment
   3. Generate validation results and diagnostic data
   4. Provides a path back to physical testing


The initial use model is fixed-route autonomous public transportation where this solution will allow cities to build robust public safety protocols.

PolyVerif Suit tries to verify safety of the Autonomous Vehicles in the context of:
    1. Dynamic: cars, pedestrians, and various models
    2. Weather: various stress points on the sensor network
    3. RF: various stress points on the communications network



Build Instructions:

PC configuration required:

•	CPU: Intel i7 10700
•	GPU: Nvidia RTX 2070 (8GB memory)
•	OS: Ubuntu 64-bit

Prerequisite:

•	Ubuntu
•	Nodejs 12.16
•	Python3.8

Note: The Simulator performance will be very slow if run on a lower PC configuration.
