# PolyVerif
PolyVerif AV Validation Suite

This is Poly-Verification and Validation Suite. Its functionality is to generate the test cases and validate the autonomous stack. 
It integrate the Scenic scenario description language with AutowareAuto and helps to generate the random scenario for simulation.
Since we are using lgsvl Simulator and AutowareAuto, it will require a high-end server with Graphics card to run it smoothly. 

The Simulator performance will be very slow if run on a lower PC configuration.

Below is the PC configuration required:
